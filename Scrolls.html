            <h1>Paris</h1>
            <p>Paris has a reputation for being the ultimate romantic getaway. But what visitors really swoon over is the city itself. Those grand stone and wrought-iron buildings, the sidewalks brimming with cosy cafés, and the Seine’s curving riverbanks are downright cinematic. But the city’s charms go beyond looks. The culinary scene creates an endless list of must-eat French dishes—rich and hearty coq au vin, golden buttery croissants. It’s also worth trying modern fusion and inventive international food here. (Trust us, the city’s falafel is outstanding.) And the spirit of Paris invites ducking down side streets, lingering in museums, and exploring mazes of shops. At the end of the day, head to the Champ-de-Mars to get uninterrupted views of the Eiffel Tower as it glitters into the night.</p>

        <div id="London">
             <h1>London</h1>
             <p>London’s a sprawling city at the centre of everything: art, history, culture—you name it. But what sets it apart from other major hubs are its distinct neighbourhoods, each with their own vibe. Spend an afternoon with the fam in Kensington: It’s got museums, parks, and plenty of other kid-approved things to do. Or check out edgy Shoreditch for cool shops and street murals (perfect for photo ops), then head to Soho where you can grab a pint at a pub or hit a club and party ‘til dawn. Food’s a big deal here: Yes, there’s fish and chips, but also next-level curry houses thanks to London’s thriving Bangladeshi community (take your pick from tons of spots on Brick Lane), plus a growing roster of celebrity chef-driven restaurants in posh Mayfair. There’s always something new going on and we’ve got more recs, below.</p>

        <div id="Tokyo">
            <h1>Tokyo</h1>
            <p>With its futuristic skyscrapers, unrivalled food scene, and wild nightlife, Tokyo is a rush of pure adrenaline. The city is famously cutting-edge, yet its ancient Buddhist temples, vintage teahouses, and peaceful gardens offer a serene escape—and a reminder of its past. Spend the morning in Asakusa, Tokyo’s historical neighbourhood, to see the Sensoji temple, then take a stroll along the Sumida River (in the spring, the cherry blossoms are in full force). Or, make your way to Tsukiji Outer Market for a sushi breakfast—the narrow corridors are packed with tons of spots to choose from (most close around noon so get there early). Turn up the volume and get a taste for cosplay culture in Harajuku, or hit Akihabara for video games and anime. In the evening, take a detour down a yokocho—a little side street alleyway—to find laid-back izakayas and chill bars. That’s only scratching the surface—we’ve got more recs below.</p>

        <div id="Dubai">
            <h1>Dubai</h1>
            <p>Everything feels extra spectacular in Dubai—from the ultra-modern Burj Khalifa to the souks and malls filled with gold and jewellery vendors. It’s a place where if you can dream it, you can do it: Whether that means skiing indoors, dune-surfing in the desert, or zip-lining above the city. But it’s not all glitz and adrenaline-pumping action. Stroll through the winding alleys of Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood to see what Dubai was like during the mid-19th century. Or visit the Jumeirah Mosque (one of the few mosques open to non-Muslims) and learn about Emirati culture. Spot some street art on Jumeirah Beach Road and grab a bite at a shawarma shop, or spend the day hunting for spices and perfume then round things out with a Michelin-starred meal. You can really do it all and we’ve got more recs, below.</p>
